Week 1:
We formed our group and we decided that our team name will be "otis". 
We split our team into 1 Scrum Master (me), 2 Backend Developers, 1 Fullstack Developer 
and 1 Frontend Developer.
We decided on our project "Task management system".

Week 2:
I setup our group's Jira and Github Classroom Repo. We finalised our functionalities and novel functionalities.
I started working on our high fidelity prototype on figma for our web application.
I initialised some of our routing using react.

Week 3:
I finished adding all our user stories to the backlog on Jira and completed our storyboarding.
We submitted our proposal and I setup our database using firestore and initialised
our backend files.

Week 4:
I completed coding login and register page for frontend as well as completing login functionality for backend.
I connected the frontend with the backend including error checking, it works well :D
I setup the routing for the next features that we will complete (tasks and dashboard).
