Week 1:
Our group was formed and named OTIS. We also decided on task management as our project and selected Edison
as our scrum master. We also setup Jira and confirmed our group on moodle 

Week 2: 
I helped out with the Figma on a call with Calvin and Edison, mainly to make decisions on how it should 
look and background etc. We started the project proposal and asked specfic questions on the spec to make
sure we had an understanding of what was expected. The project proposal was also divided into multiple
parts, and we were each assigned a part to do.

Week 3:
This week, I asked the group about our technologies/languages to confirm our tech stack for my section
(system architecture). As a result, we ended up confirming usage of Python/firebase/Javascript. During
the meetup, Calvin and I realised that the frontend design was very heavy for the proposal as it was
mainly made in Figma, so I took on writing descriptions and such for the system architecture section as 
well as making the diagram. During the tutorial, we also asked our tutor about user stories (if we have
a sufficient variety, if we need to be more specific etc.). 
By the end of the week, we finished our proposal in time for submission.

Week 4: 
This week, we began coding for Sprint 1, due in week 5. A few issues with setting up, but we got there 
in the end. This week, I started my tasks on getTaskDetails. I've spent time learning about the database
and understanding it to be able to code my assigned tasks.

Week 5: debugged get task details -> task details now fully running. We were able to demo our code in class 
on Wednesday successfully. We also had our retrospective which brought up problems of our communication, organisation
and minor clarity.

Week 6: we have decided on sprint 2, as well as allocated tasks. I have worked on connections. I also proposed
a change to the database structure for easier access (removing collection for connections).
